## What need to do and what I have not done, because it is a test exercise.
1. Add proper styles to components based on some desing system, currently it is a dummy style with `px` units, personally I prefer to use `em/rem`.
2. `Switch` component should be refactored. I just copied css styles for the component from here  https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp for saving time
3. Code should be covered by tests.
4. SASS/SCSS should be based on some desing system (predefined variables and constants for fonts, colors, margins, screen resolutions and so on).
5. Move some TS types/interfaces to sep files and move some functions to sep namespace for using it like utility function.
6. Add `Error Boundaries` for showing good error on incorect element in json dynamic structure.
7. Add `Lazy Loading` for components.
